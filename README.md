# UNSUPERVISED-MACHINE-LEARNING

Objective:
The objective of this PROJECT is to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.

Dataset
The Iris dataset which is available in the sklearn library is used.

The following steps were performed:

1. Loading and Preprocessing
Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn.
Droped the species column, since this is a clustering problem.

2.Clustering Algorithm Implementation
Implemented the following two clustering algorithms:

A) KMeans Clustering
Provided a brief description of how KMeans clustering works.
Explained why KMeans clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
Applied KMeans clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualized the clusters.

B) Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
Provided a brief description of how Hierarchical clustering works.
Explained why Hierarchical clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
Applied Hierarchical clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualized the clusters.

The code is provided in Jupyter Notebook format.
